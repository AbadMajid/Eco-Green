  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Facts and figures</h2>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Electronic waste generation :</h3>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Approximately 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste (e-waste) were generated worldwide in 2019. This figure is expected to reach 74.7 million metric tons by 2030.</p>
 
  <p style="text-align: center;">E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally.</p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Resource Consumption :</h3>
    
  <p style="text-align: center;">The production of digital devices requires the extraction of precious metals, rare earth elements, and other valuable resources.</p>
 
  <p style="text-align: center;">It takes an estimated 165 pounds (75 kilograms) of raw materials to manufacture a single smartphone.</p>
 
  <p style="text-align: center;">The production of laptops and other digital devices also contributes to deforestation, water pollution, and energy consumption.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Energy Consumption :</h3>
    
  <p style="text-align: center;">The energy consumption associated with digital devices, including manufacturing, usage, and infrastructure, is significant.</p>
 
  <p style="text-align: center;">Data centers and networks that support digital services consume massive amounts of electricity.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global electricity consumption by data centers reached around 205 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2020, accounting for 1% of global electricity demand.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Greenhouse Gas Emissions :</h3>
    
  <p style="text-align: center;">The production, usage, and disposal of digital devices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">The carbon footprint of a smartphone over its lifecycle is estimated to be around 79 kilograms of CO2-equivalent.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">Data centers and networks are responsible for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Recycling and E-Waste Management :</h3>
    
  <p style="text-align: center;">Only a small fraction of electronic waste is properly recycled. In 2019, only 17.4% of e-waste was recycled globally.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to environmental contamination and health hazards due to the release of toxic substances.</p>
